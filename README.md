# MACS 40550 Assignment 1

### Project goal
The present model builds upon the foundational principles of the Schelling model by introducing the concept of social influencers, a significant enhancement over the original framework that primarily examined how individual preferences on neighbor composition lead to segregation patterns.

### Github Navigation Steps  
* First clone the repository at your local machine.
* The structure of the repository is as follows:
   * Model.py contains all the python script for the setup of the model
   * Server.py contains all the python script for seting up and running a server.
   * requirement.text contains all the required libraries.


## Installation

To install the dependencies use pip and the requirements.txt in this directory. e.g.

```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

To run the model interactively, run ``mesa runserver`` in this directory. e.g.

```
    $ mesa runserver
```
or

Directly run the file ``run.py`` in the terminal. e.g.

```
    $ python run.py
```
